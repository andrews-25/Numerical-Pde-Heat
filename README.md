# Numerical-PDE-Heat

Undergraduate capstone project applying numerical and machine learning methods to heat equations.

This repository contains four separate folders:

- **crank-nicolson:** Contains two Python solvers for the heat equation â€” an original 1D numerical solver created for the capstone project and a 2D solver developed later for learning purposes.

- **pinns:** Includes two Python implementations solving the 1D heat equation using TensorFlow and PyTorch.

- **report:** Contains all LaTeX source files for the report, as well as the compiled PDF. The report is approximately 20 pages and provides a detailed academic perspective on the project.

- **presentation:** Contains LaTeX source files and the compiled PDF for the presentation. This presentation was delivered publicly to math professors and interested students at UNF.
